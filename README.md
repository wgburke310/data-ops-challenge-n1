# data-ops-challenge-n1
Hello! This is my git repo for the take-home data ops challenge. In this repo, you'll find my original instructions, along with a Jupyter notebook and py script for my solutions. I recommend looking at the jupyter notebook primarily: This is where I developed my solutions and is much easier to follow. To clarify, the py script contains only the code to generate answers and tables as instructed, while the notebook also contains the code I used to reach those solutions (in a cleaned-up way).
